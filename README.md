# CSS Projects 🎨

A growing collection of small CSS projects I created to practice and improve my front-end skills.  
Each folder contains a mini project focused on a specific concept or UI component.
These projects were created as part of a [FreeCodeCamp course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzuWIHGFKCQ&pp=ygVAMjQgY3NzIHByb2plY3RzIGxvYWRpbmcgYW5pbWF0aW9uIHByb2dyZXNzIGJhciBmbGFzaGNhcmRzICYgbW9yZQ%3D%3D).
